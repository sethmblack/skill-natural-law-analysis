# Natural Law Analysis

## Purpose

Derive moral obligations from rational human nature's participation in eternal law, providing a foundation for ethics that is accessible to reason and applicable across cultures, independent of (though complementary to) revealed religion.


## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle


## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Is this right or wrong?"
- "What makes something moral?"
- "Foundation of ethics"
- "What is natural law?"
- "Are there objective moral truths?"
- "Why should I be moral?"
- "Universal human rights basis"
- "Ethics without religion"
- "How do we know what's good?"

**Contexts:**
- Ethical decision-making
- Legal philosophy discussions
- Human rights foundations
- Policy evaluation
- Bioethics deliberations
- Business ethics analysis
- Personal moral dilemmas

|-------|-------------|----------|
| Action/situation | The specific action or situation to evaluate | Yes |
| Context | Relevant circumstances | No |
| Competing goods | Apparent conflicts to resolve | No |
| Objections | Moral relativist challenges to address | No |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Moral evaluation | Assessment of the action's moral status |

## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Workflow
### Step 1: Understand the Hierarchy of Law

Apply the four-fold hierarchy of law to the situation:

| Level | Description | Source | Example |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Eternal Law** | God's rational governance of all creation | Divine Wisdom | The ordered structure of reality |
| **Natural Law** | Rational creatures' participation in eternal law | Human reason | "Do good, avoid evil" |
| **Human Law** | Specific determinations by legitimate authority | Legislation | Traffic laws, tax codes |
| **Divine Law** | Revealed law (Old and New) | Scripture | The Decalogue, Beatitudes |

### Step 2: Identify the First Principles of Practical Reason

Natural law begins with self-evident principles:

**Primary precept:** "Good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided"

This is not a moral command but a description of how practical reason operates - it naturally inclines toward the good.

### Step 3: Identify the Basic Human Goods

Natural inclinations reveal basic goods that practical reason recognizes:

| Inclination | Basic Good | Derived Precepts |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Self-preservation | Life | Don't murder, preserve health |
| Sexual union and child-rearing | Family/Procreation | Marriage, child education |
| Social living | Society | Justice, common good |
| Knowledge of truth | Truth/Knowledge | Pursue truth, avoid deception |
| Knowledge of God | Religion | Worship, reverence |

### Step 4: Apply Practical Reason to the Situation

Using the basic goods as guides, reason from general principles to specific conclusions:

1. **Identify which basic good(s) are at stake**
2. **Determine what action promotes or harms these goods**
3. **Consider how the action relates to human flourishing (beatitudo)**
4. **Check for conflicts between goods and resolve through proper ordering**

### Step 5: Evaluate Human Laws Against Natural Law

Human laws derive legitimacy from natural law:

- **Just Law**: Properly derived from natural law, ordered to common good
- **Unjust Law**: Contradicts natural law, is "violence rather than law"
- **Merely Positive Law**: Indifferent matters specified by authority (e.g., drive on right side)

### Step 6: Address Apparent Conflicts

When goods seem to conflict:
1. Determine if conflict is real or apparent
2. Apply principle of double effect if relevant (see double-effect-reasoning skill)
3. Consider hierarchy of goods (spiritual > bodily, common > individual)
4. Never do evil that good may come

## Key Principles

### The Synderesis Principle
The natural habit by which we know first principles of practical reason. Unlike conscience (which can err in application), synderesis is infallible - "do good, avoid evil" cannot be not-known.

### Intrinsically Evil Acts
Some acts are always wrong regardless of intention or circumstances:
- Murder (intentional killing of the innocent)
- Lying (speaking contrary to one's mind)
- Adultery (violation of marital fidelity)

These violate basic goods directly and admit no exception.

### The Role of Prudence
Natural law provides principles; prudence (practical wisdom) applies them to particular cases. This requires:
- Knowledge of universal principles
- Understanding of particular circumstances
- Deliberation about means to ends
- Right judgment about what to do here and now

## Example Application

**User question:** "Is it ethical for a company to pay workers less than a living wage?"

**Natural Law Analysis:**

**Step 1 - Identify relevant goods:**
- Life (workers need sustenance)
- Society/Justice (fair exchange in commerce)
- Common good (social stability)

**Step 2 - Apply principles:**
- Justice requires giving to each what is due
- Work is a human act deserving just remuneration
- The laborer is worthy of his hire

**Step 3 - Reason to conclusion:**
- A "living wage" is what enables a worker to sustain life with dignity
- Paying less than this violates the basic good of life
- It also violates justice (the exchange is unfair - labor given exceeds compensation received)
- This harms the common good (society with impoverished workers is unstable)

**Step 4 - Consider objections:**
- "But the market determines wages": The market is a human institution that should serve the common good, not an amoral force to which justice must bow
- "But the company will fail if it pays more": If a business model requires unjust wages, the model is defective. One may not do evil that good may come.

**Conclusion:** Natural law requires that wages be sufficient for workers to live with human dignity. Systematically paying less than this is contrary to justice and the common good, even if legal.

## Common Objections and Responses

### "Natural law is just religious morality in disguise"
Natural law is accessible to reason alone. Aristotle (a pagan) articulated much of its content. It does not depend on revelation, though revelation confirms and extends it.

### "What's 'natural' is just what's statistically common"
"Natural" here means in accord with rational nature's proper functioning, not statistical frequency. Disease is common but not natural in this sense.

### "You can't derive ought from is"
Natural law does not derive ought from mere facts but from practical reason's apprehension of goods. The first principle of practical reason ("pursue good") is not derived but self-evident.

### "Different cultures have different morals"
Surface variations exist, but basic goods are recognized universally. All cultures prohibit unprovoked murder, honor some form of family, value truth. Variations concern applications, not principles.

## Integration Notes

**Parent Expert:** thomas-aquinas

**Related Skills:**
- **just-war-evaluation**: Applies natural law to questions of warfare
- **double-effect-reasoning**: Applies natural law to actions with mixed effects
- **virtue-integration**: Virtues are habits directing us to natural law ends
- **faith-reason-synthesis**: Natural law shows what reason alone can achieve in ethics

**Skill Interaction:**
Natural law analysis is foundational - it provides the rational basis for ethics from which other applications derive. When evaluating specific cases (war, medical decisions, etc.), first establish natural law principles, then apply relevant specialized skills.
